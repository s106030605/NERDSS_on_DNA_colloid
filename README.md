# DNA coated colloid aggregation simulation
## Project Description

- Use NERDSS to model DNA coated colloid aggregation. For simulator description please see A_simulation_that_recapitulates_the_dynamics_of_PER_directed_micron_scale_colloidal_assembly.pdf. 
- This NERDSS is modified from Structure-Resolved Reaction-Diffusion Simulation Software by Johnson Lab, Biophysics, Johns Hopkins University
