The code of continuum membrane model is programmed in C++ with Armadillo library and parallelization OpenMP.

The main code is ‘continuummodel_maincode.cpp’, and ‘funcitons_file1.cpp’ and ‘functions_file2.cpp’ list all the functions this membrane utilize. Specifically, the functions for setting up triangular mesh are listed ‘functions_file2.cpp’, and the functions for calculating the system energy and the vertex force are defined in ‘functions_file1.cpp’.

To compile the file:
g++ continuummodel_maincode.cpp -larmadillo -fopenmp -o out
Then to run the code:
./out
