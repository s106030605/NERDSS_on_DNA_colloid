To build NERDSS requires:

1. c++ compiler
   For Mac, these are provided with XCode.
2. Gnu Scientific Library installed (gsl  version 1.0 or higher)
   this can be downloaded from here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
*3. EIther cmake (version 3.0 or higher) OR can be compiled directly using our Makefile--does not require cmake.
    this can be downloaded from here: https://cmake.org/download/

3a. To compile using cmake:
    ## Quick Build
    1. Create a build directory and move into it: `mkdir build; cd build`
    2. Create the Makefile using CMake: `cmake ..`
    3. Make the executable: `make`. You can use the `-j 2` flag for quicker building.
    5. The executable is now in the build directory, entitled `nerdss`

3b. To compile using make:
    1. Move to the main directory
    2. Type 'make serial'
    3. Executable will be placed in the directory ./bin
