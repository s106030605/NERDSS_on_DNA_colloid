We use single_component.inp to denote the setup for 2014 particle A and 2014 particle B aggregation within a 100*100*100 um^3.



For temporal varying reaction rate constants, we use kinetics_t.csv to specify the rate constant over time  (per second).
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column B & C.
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column D & E.
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column F & G.
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column H & I.
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column J & K.
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column L & M.
