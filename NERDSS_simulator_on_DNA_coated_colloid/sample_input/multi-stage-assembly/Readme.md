We use multi-stages.inp to denote the setup for 1000 particle A, 1000 particle B, and 100 particle C 2 stage core-shell aggregation within a 100-um diameter spherical boundary.

The kinetics_t.csv denote the temporal-varing (s) reaction rate constants (per second).  
For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column B & C.

For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column D & E.

For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column F & G.

For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column H & I.

For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column J & K.

For on/off rate constants between particle A and A, they are specified in column L & M.
